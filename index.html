                <h2>What is the Battle of Hastings?</h2>
                <p>On October 14, 1066, at the Battle of Hastings in England, King Harold II (c.1022-66) of England was
                    defeated by the Norman forces of William the Conqueror (c.1028-87). By the end of the bloody,
                    all-day
                    battle, Harold was dead and his forces were destroyed. He was the last Anglo-Saxon king of England,
                    as
                    the battle changed the course of history and established the Normans as the rulers of England, which
                    in
                    turn brought about a significant cultural transformation.</p>
